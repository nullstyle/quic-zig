//! quic_zig.Server — production-grade convenience wrapper for embedding
//! quic_zig as a QUIC server.
//!
//! `Connection` is intentionally I/O-agnostic: it consumes incoming
//! UDP datagrams via `handle()` and produces outgoing ones via
//! `poll()`. Wiring that to a UDP socket, demultiplexing peers by
//! connection ID, applying transport-parameter templates, and
//! stepping the per-connection event loop is repetitive boilerplate
//! every embedder ends up writing.
//!
//! `Server` owns that boilerplate. It is still I/O-agnostic — the
//! embedder owns the UDP socket and the wall clock — but it owns the
//! `boringssl.tls.Context`, the per-connection lifecycle, and a
//! constant-time CID-to-slot routing table that follows
//! NEW_CONNECTION_ID issuance / RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID retirement
//! automatically.
//!
//! Routing
//! -------
//! After every successful `feed`, the slot's CID set is resynced
//! from `Connection.localScids` and the routing table is updated in
//! place — added SCIDs become routing keys immediately, retired
//! SCIDs stop accepting traffic. Lookup is `std.AutoHashMap`
//! O(1) on the length-prefixed CID bytes; reaping a slot drops
//! every CID it owned in one pass. RFC 9000 §5.1.1 lets peers pick
//! any issued CID at any time, and the router honors that without
//! the embedder writing CID-tracking glue.
//!
//! DoS posture
//! -----------
//! Three opt-in gates harden Initial-driven slot creation; each is
//! null in `Config` by default and surfaces a distinct
//! `FeedOutcome` variant when it fires.
//!
//! 1. `Config.max_initials_per_source_per_window` enables a
//!    per-source-address token bucket. When the cap is exceeded,
//!    fresh Initials from that source are dropped without state, so
//!    an attacker spraying Initials from a single address cannot
//!    exhaust the slot table or the TLS context.
//! 2. `Config.retry_token_key` enables stateless Retry-based source
//!    validation (RFC 9000 §8.1.2). The first Initial from a peer
//!    earns a Retry packet bound to its address; until the peer
//!    echoes a valid token in a follow-up Initial, no `Connection`
//!    is allocated. Set this to gate the 3x amplification window
//!    behind a proof-of-address round trip.
//! 3. Long-header packets carrying any version not in
//!    `Config.versions` (which defaults to QUIC v1 only) always
//!    trigger a Version Negotiation response (RFC 9000 §6 / RFC
//!    8999 §6 / RFC 9368 §6); this is unconditional and requires
//!    no further `Config` opt-in.
//!
//! Stateless responses (Retry, Version Negotiation) are queued on
//! the `Server` and surfaced via `drainStatelessResponse`. The
//! embedder's I/O loop polls for these in addition to per-slot
//! `poll` output and forwards them on the same UDP socket. The
//! queue is bounded — when full, the oldest queued response is
//! dropped to keep ingest latency bounded.
//!
//! All three gates require an embedder-supplied `from` address
//! when calling `feed`. When `from` is null (the embedder didn't
//! capture the peer 4-tuple), the gates degrade to pass-through:
//! the rate limiter does not track the source, no Retry is
//! attempted, and a Version Negotiation response cannot be queued
//! because there is no destination to send it to (the datagram is
//! `dropped` instead). Passing `from` is strongly recommended for
//! any internet-facing deployment.
//!
//! For a hand-rolled loop, see the README. Embedders that just want
//! "bind a socket and serve QUIC" should reach for
//! `quic_zig.transport.runUdpServer` instead — it owns the
//! `std.Io`-based bind / tune / receive / feed / poll / tick / reap
//! cadence. The QNS endpoint at `interop/qns_endpoint.zig` keeps its
//! own bespoke loop because it has interop-specific quirks
//! (deterministic CID prefix, per-testcase wiring); general-purpose
//! embedders should reach for `Server` (server side) or
//! `quic_zig.Client` (client side) first.
