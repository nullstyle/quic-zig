//! Bounded single-use cache for 0-RTT replay protection
//! (RFC 9001 §5.6, RFC 8446 §8 / §E.5).
//!
//! Per the hardening guide §5.2: enabling 0-RTT requires "an
//! anti-replay mechanism" — without it, an attacker who captures a
//! 0-RTT request can replay it for the lifetime of the resumed
//! session ticket. BoringSSL's QUIC integration deliberately delegates
//! this to the application: the server-side session cache can pin
//! tickets, but the "has this exact early-data already been seen?"
//! check has to live at a layer that knows the ticket's identity.
//!
//! `AntiReplayTracker` is the data structure that check needs.
//! Embedders that opt in to 0-RTT (`Server.Config.enable_0rtt = true`)
//! follow this workflow on every connection that 0-RTT accepts:
//!
//! ```zig
//! var tracker = try AntiReplayTracker.init(allocator, .{
//!     .max_entries = 4096,
//!     .max_age_us = 10 * 60 * std.time.us_per_s, // 10 minutes
//! });
//! defer tracker.deinit();
//!
//! // After Connection.handshakeDone() and earlyDataStatus() == .accepted:
//! const id = computeTicketIdentity(session, transport_params, ...);
//! switch (tracker.consume(id, now_us)) {
//!     .fresh => { /* OK to act on the 0-RTT request */ },
//!     .replay => { /* MUST reject — treat the early-data bytes as
//!                  unauthenticated and serve any response only at
//!                  1-RTT (i.e. after handshake completion). */ },
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! What "identity" means is up to the embedder — see "Identity
//! choice" below — but it must be stable across replays of the same
//! 0-RTT message and unique per legitimate connection attempt.
//!
//! ## Properties
//!
//! - **Bounded.** The tracker holds at most `max_entries` IDs at any
//!   moment; insertion past the cap evicts the oldest entry. A peer
//!   that sprays unique 0-RTT attempts can't grow our memory.
//! - **Time-windowed.** Entries older than `max_age_us` are pruned on
//!   insertion and on explicit `prune` calls. This ensures the cache
//!   only retains IDs for the window during which a replay is
//!   actually feasible (typically the session-ticket lifetime — 1-3
//!   ticket lifetimes is plenty of slack).
//! - **No allocator pressure on the hot path.** `consume` does at
//!   most one HashMap put + one ArrayList swap-remove. Pruning is
//!   batched on insert when the cap is reached.
//!
//! ## Identity choice
//!
//! The identity (a `[32]u8` opaque key) must:
//!
//! - **Stay constant across replays of the same 0-RTT message.** The
//!   replayed bytes will produce the same ID.
//! - **Differ across distinct legitimate 0-RTT attempts.** Two
//!   genuine clients resuming the same ticket (which shouldn't
//!   happen for single-use tickets, but can if the server issued
//!   multi-use tickets) must produce distinct IDs.
//!
//! Sensible constructions:
//!
//! 1. **Session ticket bytes**: SHA-256 of the resumed session's
//!    ticket bytes. Bound to the ticket exactly. (Requires extracting
//!    the ticket from BoringSSL's `SSL_SESSION`.)
//! 2. **Early-data digest + ClientHello random**: SHA-256 over the
//!    `early_data_context` (already computed for QUIC's
//!    `quic_early_data_context`) plus the 32-byte client random from
//!    the ClientHello. Stable for replays; differs across genuine
//!    attempts because client_random is fresh per attempt.
//! 3. **Initial DCID + early-data digest**: cheap and stable, but
//!    weaker — an attacker who can replay both the DCID and the
//!    early-data bytes captures a "same DCID + same early data"
//!    pair, which the tracker would correctly mark `.replay`. Good
//!    enough for many threat models.
