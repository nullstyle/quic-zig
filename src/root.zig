//! quic_zig - a Zig-first IETF QUIC transport implementation.
//!
//! This module is the public API surface. It re-exports the namespace
//! modules (`wire`, `frame`, `tls`, `conn`, `transport`) plus the
//! commonly-used types and the high-level `Server` convenience
//! wrapper.
//!
//! See `README.md` at the project root for an embed-as-server
//! example and the high-level architecture overview.
