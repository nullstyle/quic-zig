//! quic_zig.Connection — per-connection state machine root.
//!
//! The Connection wraps a `boringssl.tls.Conn` (the SSL object),
//! installs quic_zig's `tls.quic.Method` callbacks, and exposes a
//! deterministic `advance` driver that pulls peer-provided CRYPTO
//! bytes through `provideQuicData` + `SSL_do_handshake` until the
//! handshake completes. Once handshake is done it owns packet number
//! spaces, ACK tracking, congestion control, flow control, the
//! stream layer, the multipath `PathSet`, key updates, and the
//! close/draining lifecycle.
