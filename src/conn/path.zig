//! Path — a 4-tuple-bound bundle of QUIC connection state
//! (RFC 9000 §6, §8, §9). Each Connection holds a `PathSet` with
//! one or more Paths; migration switches the active path, multipath
//! widens the active set without restructuring the state machine.
//!
//! A Path owns:
//! - The peer + local address (the "4-tuple" minus the implicit
//!   transport protocol).
//! - The pair of Connection IDs in use on this path.
//! - Per-path anti-amplification credit (RFC 9000 §8.1).
//! - The path-validation state machine
//!   (`PathValidator`, RFC 9000 §8.2).
//! - The path's own RTT estimator and congestion controller.
//!
//! Address fields are placeholders sized for IPv6; the POSIX UDP
//! transport adapts these to `std.net.Address` at the boundary.
