//! Reference embedder for the
//! draft-munizaga-quic-alternative-server-address-00 receive surface.
//!
//! The connection's `pollEvent` returns each `ALTERNATIVE_V4/V6_ADDRESS`
//! frame as a typed `AlternativeServerAddressEvent`. quic
//! pre-filters out duplicates and stale-reorders (RFC 9000 §13.3
//! retransmits and out-of-order app-PN delivery), so the embedder
//! only sees forward-progress updates. What remains is the
//! application policy: which addresses to record, when to migrate,
//! when to retire, how to schedule the migration to avoid the §9
//! thundering-herd.
//!
//! This file ships a minimal but realistic shape:
//!
//!  - `AddressBook` — an in-memory store keyed by (kind, addr, port).
//!    Every Preferred / Retire update gets folded into the matching
//!    entry; sequence numbers are remembered so a second
//!    `process` call against the same event is idempotent.
//!  - `MigrationScheduler` — holds the next recommended migration
//!    deadline for the current Preferred target. The deadline is
//!    backed by the `alt_addr.recommendedMigrationDelayMs` helper
//!    so a malicious server that ships Preferred to many clients at
//!    once can't synthesize a thundering herd at the advertised
//!    victim.
//!  - `Embedder.run` — the recommended event-pump shape. Pulls every
//!    `ConnectionEvent`, dispatches `alternative_server_address` to
//!    the book + scheduler, and forwards any non-alt-addr event to
//!    a caller-supplied callback so this example composes with an
//!    embedder that already has a `pollEvent` loop.
//!
//! The whole thing uses only the public `quic` API surface; the
//! tests at the bottom drive it against a stubbed event stream so
//! the example doubles as a regression for the receive-side
//! contract.
