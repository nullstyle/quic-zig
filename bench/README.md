# quic-zig microbenchmarks

The benchmark harness measures low-level QUIC hot paths that are useful
to track across parser, frame, packet, and crypto-adjacent changes.

```sh
zig build bench
```

The benchmark binary is built with `ReleaseSafe` by default in an
isolated benchmark-only build. That keeps benchmark fixtures aligned with
the production safety policy while avoiding `Debug`-mode noise.

For peak-speed comparisons that deliberately disable runtime safety
checks, opt into unsafe `ReleaseFast`:

```sh
zig build bench -Dbench-unsafe-release-fast=true
```

## Output

Each benchmark prints:

```text
name: <ns/op> ns/op (<ops/sec> ops/sec, <iters> iterations)
```

The harness auto-tunes each benchmark to roughly 100 ms of wall time,
then reports the average.

For durable local or CI reports, ask the benchmark binary to write JSON:

```sh
zig build bench -- --json benchmark-report.json
```

For reports that can be rsynced from many machines into one aggregate
directory without name collisions, use directory mode:

```sh
BENCH_MACHINE_ID=workstation-a zig build bench -- --json-dir benchmark-reports
```

Directory mode writes a file named from the generation timestamp, machine
id, commit, and GitHub run id when available. If `BENCH_MACHINE_ID` is
not set, the local hostname is used.

The JSON report includes a stable schema version, toolchain and target
metadata, basic system metadata, GitHub run metadata when available, and
the per-benchmark iteration count, total time, ns/op, and ops/sec values.
The `optimize` field records the actual benchmark build mode and
`bench_unsafe_release_fast` is true only for the explicit unsafe mode.
The `system` block records `machine_id`, hostname, logical CPU count,
total memory, `uname`, and the compile target CPU model. The scheduled
GitHub Actions workflow runs the directory-mode command weekly and on
manual dispatch, then uploads `benchmark-reports/*.json` and
`benchmark-output.txt` as artifacts for trend inspection.

To collect local runs from several machines:

```sh
rsync -a host-a:/path/to/quic-zig/benchmark-reports/ aggregate-benchmarks/
rsync -a host-b:/path/to/quic-zig/benchmark-reports/ aggregate-benchmarks/
```

## Extending

Add benchmarks when a change affects a parser, frame codec, packet
builder, crypto path, stream scheduler, recovery primitive, or connection
event path that is expected to run for most packets. Keep fixtures
reusable so AEAD, packet-key, stream, and recovery setup can be shared
across related benchmarks.

Benchmarks run sequentially and single-threaded. Run on a quiet machine
for stable comparisons.

Use `zig build bench-test` to run the benchmark helper fixture tests.
That build step uses the same module wiring as `zig build bench`, so
crypto helpers that depend on BoringSSL's generated C module do not need
ad hoc `zig test` command-line wiring.
