// NEW_TOKEN issuance configuration (RFC 9000 §8.1.3 / hardening A.5).
//
// The QNS endpoint emits one NEW_TOKEN per server-side session as soon
// as the handshake is confirmed; returning interop clients echo the
// token in a future Initial's long-header Token field so the server
// can skip the Retry round-trip on that next connection. Validation
// runs before the Retry gate in the QNS Initial-handling loop so a
// valid NEW_TOKEN bypasses Retry entirely; on any failure
// (.malformed, .expired, .invalid) we fall through to Retry exactly
// the way `Server.applyRetryGate` does, so a stale or wrong-source
// token never closes the connection — it simply pays a fresh Retry
// round-trip.
//
// The key below is a deterministic 32-byte constant chosen to match
// the interop reproducibility posture of `retry_token_key`: the
// official QUIC interop runner spawns a fresh server process per
// scenario, so per-process random keys would break cross-test reuse
// of NEW_TOKENs even within a single run. Operators deploying quic_zig
// outside the interop runner should generate a key with
// `boringssl.crypto.rand.fillBytes` and persist it across restarts —
// the per-process choice here is interop-test territory only.
//
// Token persistence policy (caveat for the interop runner):
//   * Lifetime: 1 hour. The interop runner's longest sequence (e.g.
//     handshake + transfer + resumption) finishes well within this
//     window, so a token minted on the first connection of a test
//     remains valid for every subsequent connection.
//   * Rotation: keys never rotate within a process. The interop
//     runner expects deterministic behaviour across the `server`
//     and follow-up `client` invocations; rotation would force a
//     Retry round-trip that the runner doesn't budget for.
//   * Distinct from `retry_token_key`: NEW_TOKEN typically outlives
//     a Retry token by orders of magnitude, and operators rotate the
//     two on different cadences (see `src/conn/new_token.zig`).

    // longrtt testcase asserts ≥2 ClientHellos on the wire; when the
    // PTO retx is the dropped packet, only one shows up and the test
    // fails. Other implementations have enough socket-setup latency
    // that their retx misses the window.

    // 750ms of warmup is enough to push the first CH (and therefore
    // the +999ms PTO retx) past the bad window in every run we
    // tested. 100ms is not enough; we did not narrow the lower bound
    // beyond that. The warmup is gated on `apply_simulator_warmup`
    // (set only for `TESTCASE=longrtt`): we previously applied it
    // unconditionally on the assumption it was harmless. The
    // 2026-05-09 interop matrix run proved that wrong for
    // `rebind-addr` — the runner's `--first-rebind=1s` lands exactly
    // when the warmup-delayed CH hits the wire, the handshake CRYPTO
    // bytes get stranded on the pre-rebind 4-tuple, and the
    // handshake collapses into bare retransmits. Other testcases
    // either don't rebind (so the warmup is a free 750ms idle) or
    // already have RTTs / timeouts that absorb the sleep without
    // affecting outcomes; either way, only `longrtt` *needs* the
