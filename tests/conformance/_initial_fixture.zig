//! Shared "send a malicious-but-authentic Initial to a Server" fixture.
//!
//! Several conformance suites need to verify receiver-side gates that
//! fire after AEAD passes — RFC 9000 §17.2.1 (long-header Reserved
//! Bits), §12.4 (forbidden frames at Initial), and RFC 9221 §4 ¶3
//! (DATAGRAM at Initial). All three share the same shape: stand up a
//! real Server, derive client-side Initial keys from a chosen DCID,
//! seal a packet with a controlled Reserved-Bits or payload field,
//! feed it through `Server.feed`, and inspect the resulting close
//! event.
//!
//! This file ONLY exposes the fixture surface used by those tests; it
//! does not contain test blocks of its own. The leading underscore in
//! the filename keeps it lexically distinct from the per-RFC suite
//! files so it doesn't get confused for one.
//!
//! The package boundary is `tests/` (the conformance test root lives
//! at `tests/conformance.zig`), so `@embedFile("../data/...")` resolves
//! to `tests/data/` cleanly.
